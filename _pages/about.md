I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at National Taiwan University (NTU), where my research is centered on machine learning, computer vision, and biomedical signal processing. My academic pursuit is driven by a strong commitment to developing interpretable and efficient artificial intelligence models that address real-world problems.

In 2022, I co-authored a paper titled "A Visually Interpretable Detection Method Combines 3-D ECG with a Multi-VGG Neural Network for Myocardial Infarction Identification," published in Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine. This study integrates three-dimensional electrocardiogram data with deep learning frameworks to improve the interpretability of myocardial infarction detection, thereby contributing to advancements in medical diagnostics.

Expanding into few-shot learning, I collaborated on the paper "Dual Adversarial Alignment for Realistic Support-Query Shift Few-Shot Learning," which tackles domain adaptation challenges inherent in few-shot learning scenarios. Furthermore, my work on "Dual-Triangular QR Decomposition with Global Acceleration and Partially Q-Rotation Skipping" reflects my interest in enhancing computational efficiency in matrix decomposition techniques.

Most recently, my research on "BiLEE: Bi-Level Early Exiting for Generative Document Retrieval," accepted at ECAI 2024, highlights my ongoing efforts to improve the performance and efficiency of information retrieval systems through novel architectures.

I am dedicated to advancing artificial intelligence by building models that are both technically sound and practically applicable, with the broader objective of contributing to innovations that serve societal needs.
